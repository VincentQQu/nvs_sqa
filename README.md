Official implementation of "NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References" [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488)).


### Generating No-Reference Quality Representations with the Pretrained Model

To generate quality features for example Neurally Synthesized Scenes (NSS), follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute `python3 app.py`. This script processes each NSS folder within the `./examples` directory.
2. **Feature Generation and Saving**: The script iterates through all NSS folders in `./examples`, generates quality features for each, and saves these features in `./examples/output_features.npz`. `output_features.npz` is in format of {<nss_name>: 384-dim rep., ...}. (You can use `np.load()` to load it.)
3. **Example NSS Provided**: Within the `examples` folder, we include two NSS examples: one generated by GNT-Cross-scene and the other by Plenoxel.
4. **Quality Score Output**: `app.py` also calculates and outputs quality scores based on the generated features applying a ridge linear regression model on training segements of Fieldwork, Lab, and LLFF datasets.

#### Important Notes:

- **JOD Scoring Format**: The JOD score, which is the adopted scoring format, features primarily negative values (offset by reference quality), with higher scores indicating better quality.
- **Relevance of JOD Scores**: According to the dataset authors for Fieldwork and Lab, JOD scores are more meaningful within the same scene, suggesting that cross-scene comparisons of JOD scores may not provide meaningful insights.
